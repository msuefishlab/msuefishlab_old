We are pleased to announce our new postdoctoral research associate, Will Pitchers, joined the lab on August 1st, 2015.  Will comes from Ian Dworkin's lab, where he worked on the evolutionary genomics of wing shape in Drosophila.  He received his Ph.D. at the University of Exeter in 2010 working on crickets, with a thesis entitled "Trait Integration as a Constraint on Phenotypic Evolution".  Will has published many scientific papers regarding genetics and evolution, and will be a very valuable member of our team.  Welcome Will!
