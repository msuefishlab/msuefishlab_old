title: Hatching and eye development
tags: [lab, development]
---

As another day ticks by, we see that the larva has developed still further, hatching from its chorion. The eyes are now dark and pigmented and can be clearly made out along with the ears.  The dark mass in the center of the head is the brain, and you can follow the CNS through the entire body of the animal.   You may also notice that the embryo is noticeably "darker" than yesterday-- the process of melanogenesis has begun.  The animals are a dark brown color normally, and this pigmentation process will continue for the next several days.  Tomorrow, we will see more definition in the fins and the body shape start to more closely resemble the adult fish.
