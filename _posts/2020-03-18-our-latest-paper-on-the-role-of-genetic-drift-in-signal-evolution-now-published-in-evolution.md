Communication signals serve crucial survival and reproductive functions. In Gabon, the widely distributed mormyrid fish _Paramormyrops kingsleyae_ emits an electric organ discharge (EOD) signal with a dual role in communication and electrolocation that exhibits remarkable variation: populations of _P. kingsleyae_ have either biphasic or triphasic EODs, a feature that characterizes interspecific signal diversity among the _Paramormyrops_ genus. We quantified variation in EODs of 327 _P. kingsleyae_ from nine populations and compared it to genetic variation estimated from microsatellite loci. We found no correlation between electric signal and genetic distances, suggesting that EOD divergence cannot be explained by drift alone. An alternative hypothesis is that EOD differences are used for mate discrimination, which would require _P. kingsleyae_ be capable of differentiating between divergent EOD waveforms. Using a habituation‚Äêdishabituation assay, we found that _P. kingsleyae_ can discriminate between biphasic and triphasic EOD types. Nonetheless, patterns of genetic and electric organ morphology divergence provide evidence for hybridization between these signal types. Although reproductive isolation with respect to signal type is incomplete, our results suggest that EOD variation in _P. kingsleyae_ could be a cue for assortative mating.
